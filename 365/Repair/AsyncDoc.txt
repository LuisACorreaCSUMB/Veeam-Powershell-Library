Issue Being Targeted: Stuck M365 Backup jobs
The script M365_AsyncJobs is for fixing 365 jobs where some part of the job is holding up the rest of the backup.
If you notice the job being stuck, do the following.
Stop the job
Exclude the object that was getting stuck
Create a separate job for that object and make it only those objects.
Start the original job off so it can finish the needed backup.
Run the M365_AsyncJobs.ps1 and input in the necessary Job Name. Case doesn't matter
